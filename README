 -- What is it?

It started as a quite simple A/V capture based on ffmpeg for Blackmagic Design
DeckLink systems.

It wasn't and isn't exactly feature complete and had been used as testbed to
develop a crude avdevice for ffmpeg and then kept around since it comes handy
in many occasions since the avdevice has it's share of issues I don't have
time nor will to debug right now.

It had been improved thanks to TodoStreaming support to be even more useful
paired with a simple player that could be used as example for the output side
as well.

 -- How to build?

In order to build it just clone/unpack this on your Sample directory from the
DeckLink SDK and then issue "make". If you have Libav and pkg-config installed
it will build fine. Make sure you are using a quite recent Libav otherwise it
will not build.

 -- How to use?

./bmdcapture -C 1 -m 2 -I 1 -F nut -f pipe:1 | avconv -y -i - <your options here>

-I switch from the default (HDMI) source to Analog (both audio and video)

-C select the capture device if more than one is present.

-F define the container format, I suggest using nut.

-f output file name, any libavformat compatible url is supported.

-m specific modeline, resolution+framerate

NOTE: make sure you are processing frames capture in real time or be
prepared to end up using all your memory quite quickly, HD raw data
fills up memory quickly.

avconv -vsync 1 -i <source> -c:v rawvideo -pix_fmt uyvy422 -c:a pcm_s16le -ar 48000 -f nut - | ./bmdplay -f pipe:0

[TBD]

-C select the capture device if more than one is present.

-f input file name, any libavformat compatible url is supported.
